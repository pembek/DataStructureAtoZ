I have created a group of atomic functions for data structures. 

For instance creating and testing methods for trees like, isBinarySearchTree, max/minDepth(), size methods, isSame() etc.

It can be kind of a cheat sheet or a learning material for those who have just started to practice things with data structures.

Covered data structures will be listed accordingly. For now:

* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
